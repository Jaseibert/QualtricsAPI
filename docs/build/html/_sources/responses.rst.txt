Survey Responses
==================
The methods in the Responses module give you the ability pull in survey responses from a specified survey, and to get the specific
questions within the survey.

Get Responses from Survey
##########################
.. automethod:: QualtricsAPI.Survey.responses.Responses.get_responses

Example Implementation
----------------------
In this example say that we want to collect the responses from a survey that we previously conducted. We only need the survey ID,
in this case 'SV_AFakeSurveyID', and pass it as an argument to the survey_id parameter in the get_responses() method.
::
    #Setup your Credentials, if not already done.
    #You only have to do this once.

    #Import the module
    from QualtricsAPI.Survey import Responses

    #Create an instance
    r = Responses()

    #Call the method
    df = r.get_responses(survey_id='SV_AFakeSurveyID')

This will return a pandas DataFrame containing the responses from the survey with the ID, 'SV_AFakeSurveyID'.
::
               contact_id   first_name last_name                       email phone unsubscribed  language external_ref
    0  CID_FakeContactID1         John      Snow     'therealking@email.com'  None        False      'en'         None
    1  CID_FakeContactID2         Bran     Stark          'b.stark@fake.net'  None        False      None         None

Get Questions from Survey
##########################
.. automethod:: QualtricsAPI.Survey.responses.Responses.get_questions

Example Implementation
------------------------
The real benefit of the get_questions() method comes after having called the get_responses() method. Qualtrics uses an ID system
to map the actual questions asked in a survey to a set of IDs (typically dictated by chronological order). This becomes kind of a
hassle whenever you are trying to locate a specific question. Here we use the get_questions() method to get the questions associated
the survey_id, 'SV_AFakeSurveyID'.
::
    #Setup your Credentials, if not already done.
    #You only have to do this once.

    #Import the module
    from QualtricsAPI.Survey import Responses

    #Create an instance
    r = Responses()

    #Call the method
    df = r.get_questions(survey_id='SV_AFakeSurveyID')


This will return a pandas DataFrame containing the questions associated with the given survey.
::
               contact_id   first_name last_name                       email phone unsubscribed  language external_ref
    0  CID_FakeContactID1         John      Snow     'therealking@email.com'  None        False      'en'         None
    1  CID_FakeContactID2         Bran     Stark          'b.stark@fake.net'  None        False      None         None
